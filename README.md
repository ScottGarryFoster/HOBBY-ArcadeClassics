# Arcade Classics
This project is an attempt to prototype programming in Unity by creating simple arcade games. This project is playground to test out methods and disciplines such as Test Driven Development, Clean Code and Architecture in preparation for larger projects.

## Projects
The planned projects under this repository are as follows:
1. Snake Game (classic Arcade and Nokia game)
2. Pac-man arcade game
3. Space Invaders

## Progress
1. Snake Game 10%
2. Pac-man 0%
3. Space Invades 0%

## Milestones / History
This is a record of notable times in the project a snapshot was taken.
### Snake Movement
The initial player movement took the longest, as this was designed to be quite flexible. The entire system was designed to be testable but refactorable with the player logic contained within SnakePlayer and then shared logic extracted out.

# Standards and Research
This project exists as a prelude to the 'Snake' project found here: [Project-Snake](https://github.com/ScottGarryFoster/PROJECT-Snake) which contains the coding standards for this project and during the course of the Arcade Classics project will be prepared for development.
